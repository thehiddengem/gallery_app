# Flutter Image Gallery App
# Overview
This Flutter Image Gallery App is a mobile application that allows users to view and like web images from an external API. Users can also mark images as favorites and view them in a dedicated "Favorites" screen. The app fetches a list of web images from a remote source, displays them in a gallery, and provides a detailed view for each image.

# Final Questions
1) The assessment took approximately 2 and a half hours to complete. The task that took significantly longer than the others was formatting the carousel card because I initially did not know how to use clipBehavior: Clip.antiAlias.
2) To address this, I conducted a small research to understand how to use it effectively. After finding the necessary information, I was able to implement it correctly in the code.
3) Yes, this assessment was feasible for the time given, and it was relatively easy to follow. The instructions provided were clear and concise, making it straightforward to work on the project. However, the specific challenge of formatting the carousel card briefly slowed down the process, but it was resolved with research. Overall, I found the assessment enjoyable and a practical way to evaluate skills compared to traditional coding tests like LeetCode.
