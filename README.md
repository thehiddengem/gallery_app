#Final Questions
1)How long did the assessment take to complete? Was there any task that took significantly longer than the others, and if so why?
The assessment took approximately 2 and a half hours to complete. The task that took significantly longer than the others was formatting the carousel card because I initially did not know how to use clipBehavior: Clip.antiAlias. To address this, I conducted a small research to understand how to use it effectively. After finding the necessary information, I was able to implement it correctly in the code.
2)Were there any tasks that you initially did not know how to complete? And if so, how did you approach them and take the steps to learn how to complete them? (It's okay if the answer is yes! Everyone learns on the job at some point)
Answered above. 
3)Was this assessment feasible for the time given and relatively easy to follow? Any points of feedback?
Yes, this assessment was feasible for the time given, and it was relatively easy to follow. The instructions provided were clear and concise, making it straightforward to work on the project. However, the specific challenge of formatting the carousel card briefly slowed down the process, but it was resolved with research. Overall, I found the assessment enjoyable and a practical way to evaluate skills compared to traditional coding tests like LeetCode.
